## Business Analysis
  In Business Analysis we have focused on looking at the growth of business by various factors
  
  •) Business profit growth quarterly and yearly
  
  •) Business users growth quarterly and yearly
  
  •) Average order value quarterly and yearly
  
  •) Profit gap effect quarterly and yearly (Profit gap effect is the percentage of total profit which is effected by refunds)

  ### Conclusion 
Upon analyzing graphs it can be seen that business growth has been exponential in year 2014 and we must dig deep to know reasons

## Refunds Analysis
  In Refunds Analysis, focus is on finding trends of refunds by various factors

  •) Average Refund percentage by quarters

  •) Refund percentage yearly

  •) Median Refund duration (9 Days)

  •) Return trigger in each quarter (Return trigger is the minimum amount of sales order per refund order)

  ### Conclusion
   Upon analyzing we find that overall refund percentage is declining by time but there are 2 key points 
   1) 3rd Quarter Return madness, In 3rd Quarter we get maximum refunds and return trigger is of 11 orders
   2) Return percentage is declining but in 2014 its declining rate has slowed down
    
We must dig further to connect dots

 ### Conclusion
 Upon analyzing we find that
